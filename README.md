Voter ID Application using Object-Oriented Programming and Custom Exception Handling

Description:
The objective of this project is to design and develop a Java-based console application that collects and validates voter details such as name, gender, and age.
The system ensures only valid and eligible users are registered by applying the principles of Object-Oriented Programming and Custom Exception Handling.
The project aims to provide a robust, reusable, and well-structured approach to input validation and error management.The system validates each input field, throws meaningful custom exceptions for invalid entries, and continues operation without crashing.It provides a smooth, user-friendly experience, and demonstrates professional-level program design.This project showcases how OOP design and exception handling can be combined to create secure, reliable, and well-organized software systems.
